                    <li>Language is focused on code readability. Which means that the syntax is simple and easy to learn.</li>
                    <li>A high level scripting language that runs virtually anywhere.</li>
                    <li>Code becomes easier to maintain due to the easy readability.</li>

                <p>Python is a popular high-level general purpose language. It was developed by Guido van Rossum in 1991. One of it's main attractions that
                   programmers have towards this language is that you can write more with less. It takes much less time to write the same piece of code in Python than in c++, for example.</p>
